# NumberRecognition

This repo is about a personal implementation of a Deep Neural Network from scratch, that is, without any deep learning framewrok and only using `numpy` for fast execution purposes.

More precisely, in [this python module](/model/RedNeuronal.py), you can find an implementation of a fully connected neural network a.k.a multi-layer perceptron.

## Trained example model

This repo also provides a [trained model](/model/saved_models/red_guardada.pickle) with the [mnist digit dataset](/model/data/mnist.pkl.gz), which achieved a
