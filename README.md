# About this Guithub repository
This repo is about a [personal implementation]((/model/RedNeuronal.py)) of a fully connected neural network a.k.a multi-layer perceptron.

The implementation has been done from scratch, that is, without any deep learning framework and only using `numpy` for fast execution purposes.



## Trained example model for number recognition

This repo also provides a [trained model](/model/saved_models/red_guardada.pickle) with the [mnist digit dataset](/model/data/mnist.pkl.gz), which achieved a `82.68%` accuracy in the test dataset.
